    # for each known container type, we can optionally provide a tuple
    # specifying: type, transform, aggregator
    # even immutable types need to be included, since their items
    # may make them unhashable

    # transformation may be used to enforce the desired iteration
    # the result of a transformation must be an iterable
    # default: no change; for dictionaries, we use .items() to see values

    # usually transformation choice only affects efficiency, not correctness

    # aggregator is the function that combines all items into one object
    # default: frozenset; for ordered containers, we can use tuple

    # aggregator choice affects both efficiency and correctness
    # e.g., using a tuple aggregator for a set is incorrect,
    # since identical sets may end up with different hash values
    # frozenset is safe since at worst it just causes more collisions
    # unfortunately, no collections.ABC class is available that helps
    # distinguish ordered from unordered containers
    # so we need to just list them out manually as needed
